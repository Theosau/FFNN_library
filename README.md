# FFNN_library
Development of a NN library for insurance contracts.

Highlights:
  - Constructed a neural network library from scratch using Python built-in functions and NumPy which includes linear and activation and loss functions. 
  - Built and evaluated a classifier to predict if an individual is likely to make an insurance claim based on a historical simplified insurance dataset.
